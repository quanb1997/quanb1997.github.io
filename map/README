Country data from naturalearthdata.com, rendered with node-canvas.

http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/

Converted to JSON with ogr2ogr:
ogr2ogr -f "GeoJSON" 110m_admin_0_countries.json 110m_admin_0_countries.shp

There are quite a few hacks here to get Gapminder countries matching up
with Natural Earth countries. Wouldn't consider this general purpose code!
